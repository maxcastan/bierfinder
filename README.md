# bierfinder

Google Cloud Platform:
-Instance ID:team-dynamo

-Instance Connection name: cop4710project-258017:us-east1:team-dynamo
(pretty sure cop4710project-258017 is what you use to connect though)

-I created a database called Bierfinder, if you click on the little cloud shell icon in the top right of the instance page, you can use SQL commands there to manipulate the DB: gcloud sql connect team-dynamo --user=root to connect to the DB

-password for root is: cop4710

Software tools: Download Intellij IDE from jetbrains, use student license

//How I believe to setup MySql DB--we have a Gradle app so don't worry about maven and pom.xml stuff
//Note install MySql version 5.7
